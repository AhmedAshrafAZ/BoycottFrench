# BoycottFrensh
An extension that helps Muslims boycott French products on E-commerce websites.
  
## What is this?
  This is an extension that acts as a look-up of the top French brands, whenever the user opens a page of French product, the extension will automatically warn the user so he/she can look for alternatives.

## Motivation
  The attacks on our prophet Muhammed -صلى الله عليه وسلم - and our religion Islam are getting more and more vicious. The attacks and the insults are either done or supported by highly french figures including government representatives. This can't be accepted in any way, shape, or form. Boycotting frensh products is our first step to reply on french government acts. This extension acts as one small contribution to this cause. 

## Installation
  - Install from chrome web store: https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/boycott-frensh/ichikjifkfpdaohfjoaejebidimfmecp?hl=en&authuser=0
## Status
  Currently, the extension is supported on google chrome browser, and it works for Jumia and Souq.com only.
  We are planning to extend this to other browsers and famous E-commerce websites.
